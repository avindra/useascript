`useascript` is a repository of userscripts for a clearer Internet ðŸŒƒ

## Name meaning

The name (`use`-`a`-`script`) denotes that the various scripts supporting many websites are loaded from a `single` script. This is done to conveniently manage many userscripts and simplify the development / testing model. At the same time, it eliminates the need for a 3rd party host.

## Usage

- [Install from GitHub](https://github.com/avindra/useascript/raw/main/hook.user.js)
  ([Source](./hook.user.js))

Note that, as per the `@match` directive, it will run on <strong>all
websites</strong>.

```
// @match        *://*/*
```
